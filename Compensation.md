## Compensation model for application development

Most business models have to start somewhere. This is our attempt to outline how the compensation structure be evolved so that developing a dapp is as fair as possible.

### Principles (this needs to evolve)
An application needs quite a few components to succeed in addition to the core technology. Though, each component as whole needs to come together to help the application be usable and accessible for the application to be successful. As in anything, definition of success needs to be defined though one of the principles we would like to follow is that merit and effort gets rewarded as well as limited disputes when the application is launched and generates revenue for the group.

### Bounty for tasks.
Once a task has been defined, we will create a bounty and use 
bountypoker to arrive at a consensus.

### Task workflow

A task can be in one of following states
	* Started 
	* Completed
	* Rejected

### Votes on a task
Once a task has been created, each task is assigned some points that gets voted upon. This step is important as the success of the application depends on this. Once a vote reaches a consensus on the points, an equivalent tezzies is assigned to be paid to the worker once the task is completed. Each task has two components:
	* The bounty points mapped to tezzies.
	* A royalty structure for a specific time (TBD) in basis points or microtezzies or a reasonable amount. 

### Mob programming
Pair/mob programming improves code quality, therefore ideally, all tasks should have at least 2 persons and the task bounties get split evenly. This might be controversial, though, in our opinion, expertise can be built and if the difference is huge perhaps  the team can be restructured and the bounties could be appropriately adjusted. 

### Expert level tasks
Some tasks need experts and the application should attribute them as such and pay the experts their true value.
