We would like to present the need to think about formal specification during design even if the automated tool that the Tezos folks are working on is not yet complete for proving michelson contracts. Is there a status update on the timeline for this?

I would like us to have this call so we can outline the process and the work we have accomplished so far to see how to incorporate the funds for your time and also see if we can present the aspect of formal verification as a value proposition to the foundation.  

I am attaching some documents (still a work in progress)  that outlines the current process and the need for this dapp. As a background, this dapp is designed to supplement an existing process that I work with as part of a cleanup company that I run out of the US (the laws could be differ from state to state, though the levels of contamination that are allowed for a particular compound are usually agreed upon based on the health impact as well as the availability of space. The initial version of the dapp will entirely focus on the US markets, unfortunately, because that's all the market i have some experience with.) and the goal of this app at a very high level is 
Implementing and managing controls that are usually tied to the licensing requirements by the state. 
Increase transparency of the in-process data to establish trendlines etc. to communicate progress to the investment group.
Transaction fees. General clean costs range between USD 40,000 - USD 250,000. Saving 3 percent transaction fees can help improve the outcome. The dapp is quite niche and i dont expect it to be used by more than 1000 users at a time. Though, the lab reports, dep meetings (some are described in the document), insurance certificates, risk assessments are today being held in their own centralized repository. We start with a small subset I can learn about the issues involved in building a usable dapp and increase the scope of the data as part of the roadmap and of course on the success of the app. 
The dapp would expect to be paid about .5 - 1% on the final transaction or the cleanup costs whichever is greater.
